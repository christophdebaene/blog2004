This is my old blog site starting from 2004 until 2014 that was initially in DasBlog and now converted to [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

I started a new blog site at [christophdebaene.github.io](https://christophdebaene.github.io), but the old can still be accessed [here](https://christophdebaene.github.io/blog2004)
