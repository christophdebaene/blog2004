# Blog 2004-2014

This site contains my original blog posts from 2004 to 2014. The blog was originally built with [DasBlog](https://github.com/shanselman/dasblog) and has since been migrated to [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
I later started a new blog at [christophdebaene.github.io](https://christophdebaene.github.io). The archived version of the original blog remains available [here](https://christophdebaene.github.io/blog2004).

## Setup

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
