But there are some problems. For example if you are writing an exe-application and added some components in the exe-project, you cannot add them to the toolbox, because the toolbox only accepts DLLs. Another issue is when you are developing a set of components in a control library, you will have to refresh the toolbox for each component you added in the library, it is not automatically refreshed and is time-consuming. Besides that there are some controls in .NET that are not displayed in the toolbox, for example the PropertyGrid.</p> <p>ComponentDropper allows you to drop a component on the designer surface from a set of assemblies.

In most of the cases typed collections only differ in the type they get and set.</p> <p>To make things easier we can do the following. Create an integer collection class, like below:</p> <pre><code>using System; \nusing System.Collections; \nusing ItemType = System.Int32;\n\npublic class IntCollection : CollectionBase { \n\n  public void Add(ItemType val) \n  {\n    this.List.Add(val); \n  }\n\n  public void Remove(ItemType val) \n  { \n    this.List.Remove(val); \n  }\n\n  public ItemType this[int index] \n  { \n      get { return (ItemType)this.List[index]; } \n      set { this.List[index] = value; } \n  } \n} \n</code></pre> <p>Here we use an alias named <code>ItemType</code> that denote the type that the collection must work with. If we want a collection of the class <code>Employee</code>, we simply copy/paste the <code>IntCollection</code> class and change the class name to <code>EmployeeCollection</code> and set the <code>ItemType</code> to <code>Entities.Employee</code> for example. So we have something like:</p> <pre><code>using System; \nusing System.Collections; \nusing ItemType = Entities.Employee;\n\npublic class EmployeeCollection: CollectionBase \n{ \n  public void Add(ItemType val) \n  { \n    this.List.Add(val); \n  } \n\n  public void Remove(ItemType val) \n  { \n    this.List.Remove(val); \n  } \n\n  public ItemType this[int index] \n  { \n    get { return (ItemType)this.List[index]; } \n    set { this.List[index] = value; } \n  } \n}\n</code></pre> <p>Offcourse you can use search and replace, but I found this method more elegant :-)</p>","tags":["net-sdk"]},{"location":"teched-2004-first-day/","title":"TechEd 2004, first day","text":"<p>The first opening key note was very entertaining and refreshing.

Surprisingly there was no pricing indicated :-)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I think it was at the expo from AOpen that a couple of case-mods were shown. One of the most original one was certainly this one:</p> <p></p> <p>One of the manufactors that i didn't want to miss was Asus.

As you can see the board is huge and I don't think it will fit on every motherboard and/or case, but it's still a prototype of course.</p> <p></p> <p>One of the things I focused on, was SATA PCI-Express RAID cards because I am planning to buy one for my system.

The motherboard is from Asus, the A8N SLI Deluxe which has 2 SATA controllers, the Silicon Image 3114R and NForce4. I also purchased a WD Raptor\u00a0as boot disk which is connected\u00a0to the NVRaid because it supports NCQ and the SI3114R not.</p> <p>First of all I wanted to test if my raptor was faster than a\u00a0normal 7200 rpm HD. And thankfully this was the case, it was about 10MB/s faster.</p> <p>RAPTOR 74GB </p> <p></p> <p>7200RPM 200GB </p> <p></p> <p>After that I tested some RAID (0, 1, 10) configurations on the SI3114 controller. One thing was clear, that mirroring on the SI3114 isn't optimized for reading, it's even a little bit slower than reading from a single disk. This has also been confirmed in a review (images are broken) from xbitlabs, where they also conclude that it doesn't have any optimizations for mirrored arrays, but focuses on RAID0. As you can see from the benchmarks there is no performance gain in RAID 1 (left below image) against a single disk (right up image), and RAID10 performs like a RAID0.</p> <p>RAID 1 STRIPE 64 </p> <p></p> <p>RAID 10 STRIPE 64 </p> <p></p> <p>So, the SI3114 was not an option for me. Then I looked for setting up a software raid in Windows XP. Yes indeed, you can build a RAID 5 in Windows XP after doing a little hack :-). For more information check out the article at tomshardware named Using WindowsXP to Make RAID 5 Happen.</p> <p>Here I did a benchmark with a stripe size of 0.5 (default) and 64K. As you can see this gives a\u00a0big difference.</p> <p>RAID 5 STRIPE 0.5 </p> <p></p> <p>RAID 5 STRIPE 64 </p> <p></p> <p>From the benchmarks with default stripe size I conclude that the read performance of RAID5 is about the same compared to a single disk, but the write performance is about the half of a single disk. This solution did not satisfy for me, because the performance is not what I expected, consumes CPU and I don't like the idea that I had to enable it by hacking some DLLs in Windows and there were some issues with Service Pack 2.</p> <p>Therefore I concluded to buy a PCI-Express SATA Raid controller, namely the Areca 1220. The Areca RAID controllers perform very well and include all the RAID features you need. A very detailed review with a lot of benchmarks can be found here.</p> <p>The ASUS A8N SLI Deluxe does have 2x 8xPCI-Express ports, which can be used for example for one VGA card and a RAID card, it doesn't need to be 2 VGA cards. To be sure I sended an email to Asus to ask if the Areca controller is compatible with the motherboard. The Areca stand at CeBIT told me they sended controllers to different manufactors (Asus, MSI, etc.) to test the compatibility and will update the 'Compatibility list' on the website.</p> <p>UPDATE: Until now it's not yet possible to combine for example one VGA and one RAID card in an SLI Motherboard, it's a BIOS issue.

These resources can be to a database, web service, registry, file system, etc. It's a good practice to encapsulate all these dependent resources into services, such that the consumer (caller of the service) doesn't need to know the implementation details and the origin of the data.</p> <p>That pattern is used a lot and is called a Service Gateway or Service Agent. There is a discussion on the difference between a Service Gateway that can be seen as consumer of a service and a Service Agent as a provider, but in the community both terms are used and mixed. The dependency between the consumer and the service is a contract which is typically a set of interfaces and business entities. In most cases, the service interface acts as a facade pattern, it encapsulates all subsystems underneath.</p> <p></p> <p>A typical example of a service agent is:</p> <pre><code>public interface ICustomerAgent \n{ \n  Customer GetCustomer(int customerId); \n  Order[] GetOrders(int customerId); \n} \n</code></pre> <p>Note that the interface doesn't expose any details about the underlying system (e.g. database, xml, etc.) and communication protocol (e.g. web service, remoting, etc.).</p> <p>Programming the UI of an application is typically the most difficult part and a challenge to achieve encapsulation and loose coupling. Thankfully there is for .NET 2.0 the Composite UI and the Smart Client Baseline Architecture Toolkit which guides you to an architecture for developing smart clients. Offcourse there is still the bible that every developer should read/know, it's the GoF book that describes a set of design patterns.</p> <p>One of the drawbacks of a designer like in Visual Studio.NET, is that it is so easy to drag and drop (in dutch I call it 'drag en drol') components, change some attributes and going through wizards for making your application. For prototyping and demo's this is good enough, but for real enterprise applications it's not. If you want you can write an application that has only one class (= form), named Form1.cs that includes all UI logic, business logic, data access, security, etc but that's not what we want.</p> <p>Building the UI is basically populating UI controls with data that resides in business entities. This means that for example an array of customers that must be shown in a list, means that every customer entity must be translated to a ListViewItem (if we don't use databinding). In most of the cases this logic resides in the form/usercontrol itself, but in fact it can be seen as a separated responsability for mapping a customer entity to a ListViewItem and vice versa (like in SC-BAT). This means that we can have something like:</p> <pre><code>public static class CustomerMapper \n{ \n  public static ListViewItem ToListViewItem(Customer customer) { ... } \n  public static Customer FromListViewItem(ListViewItem listViewItem) { ... } \n} \n</code></pre> <p>And in your form/usercontrol you write:</p> <pre><code>foreach (Customer customer in customers) \n  customerListView.Items.Add(CustomerMapper.ToListViewItem(customer)); \n</code></pre> <p>In every project there are some OO concepts and patterns I always try to achieve maintainability and extensibility. Making good OO designs is in my opinion a matter of experience, creativity and making abstractions. My conclusion...</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>The art of OO programming is to define the set of responsabilities (= objects), to encapsulate and to interact them in a loosely coupled way.</p>","tags":["patterns-practices"]},{"location":"how-to-install-mediawiki-in-11-steps/","title":"How to install MediaWiki in 11 Steps","text":"<p>MediaWiki is a Wiki software licensed under GPL and written in PHP.

Therefore I created a .NET webservice that provides the method <code>Parse</code> with the parameters <code>code</code> and <code>languagekey</code> (= C#, SQL, XMl, etc.) which returns a HTML string.</p> <pre><code>using System; \nusing System.Web; \nusing System.Web.Services; \nusing System.Text; \nusing System.Web.Services.Protocols; \nusing System.Configuration; \nusing ActiproSoftware.CodeHighlighter; \nusing ActiproSoftware.SyntaxEditor;\n\n[WebService(Namespace = \"http://tempuri.org/SyntaxHighlighting\")] \n[WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1)] \npublic class SyntaxHighlighting : System.Web.Services.WebService { \n\n  [WebMethod] \n  public string Parse(string code, string languageKey) \n  { \n      if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(code)) \n        return string.Empty;\n\n      SyntaxLanguage language = GetSyntaxLanguage(languageKey); \n      if (language == null) \n        throw new ApplicationException(\"LANGKEYNOTEXIST\");\n\n      CodeHighlighterEngine engine = new CodeHighlighterEngine(); \n      engine.OutliningEnabled = false; \n      return engine.GenerateHtmlInline(string.Empty, code, language); \n  }\n\n  CodeHighlighterConfiguration GetCodeHighlighterConfig() \n  { \n      CodeHighlighterConfiguration config = (CodeHighlighterConfiguration)HttpContext.Current.Cache[\"CodeHighlighterConfig\"];\n      if (config == null) \n      { \n          config = (CodeHighlighterConfiguration)ConfigurationManager.GetSection(\"codeHighlighter\"); \n          HttpContext.Current.Cache.Insert(\"CodeHighlighterConfig\", config); \n      }\n\n      return config; \n  }\n\n  SyntaxLanguage GetSyntaxLanguage(string languageKey) \n  { \n      if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(languageKey)) \n        return null;\n\n      CodeHighlighterConfiguration config = GetCodeHighlighterConfig(); \n      foreach (string key in config.LanguageConfigs.Keys) \n        if (key.ToLower() == languageKey.ToLower()) \n          return CodeHighlighter.GetLanguage(config, key);\n\n      return null; \n  } \n} \n</code></pre> <p>In MediaWiki you can extend WikiText so that for example your xml tag is recognized by the parser. This way you can extend the HTML output. In this example you would write in WikiText the following statements:</p> <pre><code>&lt;code language=\"C#\"&gt; \n  public int x = 5; \n&lt;/code&gt; \n</code></pre> <p>In the extensions folder of MediaWiki you add a file called <code>CodeHighlighting.php</code> with the following content:</p> <p><pre><code>&lt;?php\n\n$wgExtensionFunctions[] = \"wfCodeHighlightingExtension\";\n\nfunction wfCodeHighlightingExtension() \n{ \n  global $wgParser; \n  $wgParser-&gt;setHook('code', 'renderCode'); \n}\n\nfunction renderCode($input=\"\", $argv=array()) \n{ \n  $result = SyntaxHighlighting($input, $argv['language']); \n  return ' &lt;pre&gt;' . trim($result) . '&lt;/pre&gt; '; \n}\n\nfunction SyntaxHighlighting($code, $languageKey) \n{ \n  $location = 'http://localhost/SyntaxHighlightingWS/SyntaxHighlighting.asmx?wsdl'; \n  $result = $code;\n\n  try \n  { \n    $client = new SoapClient($location); \n    $arr = array(\"code\" =&gt; $code, \"languageKey\" =&gt; $languageKey); \n    $result = $client-&gt;Parse($arr)-&gt;ParseResult; \n  } \n  catch(SoapFault $exception) \n  { \n    if (strpos($exception-&gt;faultstring, \"LANGKEYNOTEXIST\") === false) \n    { \n      throw $exception; \n    } \n  } \n\n  return $result; \n} \n?&gt; \n</code></pre> Through the <code>setHook</code> method you can extend WikiText. Here the method <code>renderCode</code> is called when a XML element named 'code' is inside your WikiText. Calling a web service in PHP 5 is easy with the SoapClient object. If the language we pass does not exist, we simply return the original string.</p> <p>One more thing must be done, is to add an include in the <code>LocalSettings.php</code> in your MediaWiki folder.</p> <pre><code>include(\"extensions/CodeHighlighting.php\");\n</code></pre> <p>Finally: </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"applied-patterns--part-2/","title":"Applied Patterns \u2013 Part 2","text":"<p>Building an application and/or library usually starts with an OO design. Typically from that design you will define interfaces and implement base classes, which can be used as a starting point for building your application.</p> <p>Defining the signature of a base class is very important. More specific, the visibility (public, protected &amp; private) and purpose (virtual or not) of the methods are very important. Take for example an order-entry form based application that contains several screens for adding and updating data. Every screen will need to implement a kind of save method for persisting the changes. The very basic structure of your design can be:</p> <pre><code>public interface IDataView \n{ \n  void Save() \n}\n\npublic class DataViewBase: IDataView \n{ \n  public virtual void Save() \n  {     \n  } \n} \n</code></pre> <p>Here the intention is that for example every screen of your application need to inherit from <code>DataViewBase</code> and implement the <code>Save</code> method. The problem with this design, is that the interface is marked as virtual (see Virtuality) and is responsible for two jobs, namely that it is part of an interface and for specifying the implementation.</p> <p>A better way is to apply the Template Method design pattern, also called the\u00a0 'Hollywood principle', that is, 'Don't call us, we'll call you'. (This pattern is also used a lot throughout the .NET SDK library.)</p> <pre><code>public class DataViewBase: IDataView \n{ \n  public void Save() \n  { \n    DoSave(); \n  }\n\n  protected virtual void DoSave() \n  { \n  } \n}\n</code></pre> <p>This way you have complete control of the interface and you can easily add some logging before and after the save for example, extra checks, etc. If for example you need to implement whether a form-screen is dirty or not, you can easily plug it in as follow:</p> <pre><code>public class DataViewBase: IDataView \n{ \n  public void Save() \n  { \n      // do some checks \n      // do some logging\n\n      if (IsDirty()) \n        DoSave(); \n  }\n\n  protected virtual void DoSave() \n  {     \n  }\n\n  protected virtual bool IsDirty() \n  { \n    return true; } \n  }\n</code></pre> <p>If for example you need to extend the application such that when the screen is dirty you get a dialog box asking if you want to save or not. You can simply change the Save method without affecting the derived classes</p> <pre><code>public class DataViewBase: IDataView \n{ \n  public void Save() \n  { \n    // do some checks \n    // do some logging\n\n    if (IsDirty()) \n      if (MessageBox.Show(\"Do you want to save?\", \"Information\", MessageBoxButtons.YesNo, MessageBoxIcon.Question) == DialogResult.Yes) \n      DoSave(); \n  }\n\n  protected virtual void DoSave() \n  {     \n  }\n\n  protected virtual bool IsDirty() \n  { \n    return true; \n  } \n} \n</code></pre> <p>Due to the fact that the interface and the custom implementation is separated, we can easily extend and have control of the interface. In the other case we would have a lot of code duplication and in most cases we would violate the Liskov Substitution principle.</p>","tags":["patterns-practices"]},{"location":"the-power-of-a-markup-language/","title":"The power of a markup language","text":"<p>One of the most popular markup languages is HTML. A markup language contains text and meta data about the text, such as layouts, styles, etc. Now Wiki sites are becoming\u00a0more and more popular, and most of them use a customized markup language for HTML. One of the popular wiki sites is Wikipedia and is based on MediaWiki which uses WikiText as a markup language.</p> <p>Here you find the syntax of WikiText. For example an asterix (*) is used for generating lists, the equal sign (=) can be used for sections, and there are many other constructions possible. For example templates are also possible, then contructions such as this can be made:</p> <p></p> <p>There is also an extension called Wikitex for WikiText which is based on LaTeX. Where is the time that I wrote my thesis with pdfLaTeX using the MiKTeX distribution and WinEdt as my editor, very powerfull tool!

With this library you can also describe your uml and a picture is generated for you. Examples can be found here.</p> <p></p> <p>In my opinion, it becomes more important to have markup languages for the web\u00a0(generates html, images, javascript, etc.). The big advantage is the flexibility of adding and updating the content very easily, without the need of extra tools and/or uploading images. Certainly when you have a wiki based site, where everybody can change the content.</p> <p>On every site, whether through MediaWiki, Sharepoint, DotNetNuke or something else, knowledge has to be shared, and each site has its purpose. For example, a developer site has the need for syntax highlighting, uml diagrams, etc, whereas a mathematical site has the need for writing formulas, plots, etc.</p> <p>Ithink there is a need for a new library (application block) in the .NET community similar to WikiText. A markup language for the web that can be customized, extended and that can be incorporated in each application. Wouldn't it be great that you\u00a0could write your blog through WikiText.NET? :) I think this can be a good subject for the contest.</p>"},{"location":"deckworkspace-extension-cab--prevent-drawing-controls-until-all-controls-are-initialized/","title":"DeckWorkspace extension (CAB) \u2013 Prevent drawing controls until all controls are initialized","text":"<p>CAB is an application block for building smart clients in .NET 2.0 and contains proven practices for building complex UI forms with so called SmartParts and Workspaces.

For example the url http://ws.geonames.org/countryInfo? gives an xml with all countries, whereas the following request http://ws.geonames.org/postalCodeSearch?placename=be gives us all postcodes for a particular country (e.g. Belgium).</p> <p>Most likely you need two dropdown lists, one for countries and one for postcodes, where the postcode dropdown is dependent from the country dropdown list.

Through CSLA.NET you can easily provide your own custom rules. Enterprise Library v3.0 now also contains a validation application block (VAB) that can be used through attributes and even from a configuration file.</p> <p>The two validation mechanisms of validation are complementary. This can be done by adding a custom rule that uses the ValidationFactory of the VAB.

Most of the time, you have, for example, infrastructure code for doing logging, dirty tracking, lazy loading, caching, etc. Often infrastructure code is scattered over a number of modules making it harder to maintain and understand. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) solves this problem by allowing the programmer to express cross-cutting concerns in stand-alone modules called aspects.</p> <p>When you apply domain-driven design, you often have the need for dirty tracking, check on a business entity whether the entity has changed (is dirty) or not. There are a lot of different implementations for dirty tracking, but in this article we are doing it by using an interface called <code>IDirty</code> that contains a property called <code>IsDirty</code> and the setter properties of your entity object calls the <code>IsDirty</code> if the value has changed.</p> <pre><code>public interface IDirty\n{\n   bool IsDirty { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class Customer : IDirty\n{\n   private string _firstName;\n   private string _lastName;\n\n   public bool IsDirty { get; set; }\n\n   public string FirstName\n   {\n      get { return _firstName; }\n      set\n      {\n         if (value != _firstName)\n            IsDirty = true;\n         _firstName = value;\n      }\n   }\n\n   public string LastName\n   {\n      get { return _lastName; }\n      set\n      {\n         if (value != _lastName)\n        IsDirty = true;\n\n            _lastName = value;\n      }\n   }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see from the example, if you have a lot of properties, you end up by having a lot of infrastructure code and repeated code in each setter. What we want to achieve, is to annotate the setter property through an attribute called <code>DirtyAttribute</code> and that the dirty logic is centralized in one module.</p> <pre><code>[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method, AllowMultiple = false, Inherited = true)]\npublic class DirtyAttribute : System.Attribute\n{\n}\n\npublic interface IDirty\n{\n   bool IsDirty { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class Customer : IDirty\n{\n   public bool IsDirty { get; set; }\n\n   public virtual string FirstName { get; [Dirty] set; }\n   public virtual string LastName { get; [Dirty] set; }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that these are the only dependencies needed inside your domain model project. Now we need to make clear to Unity that we need to intercept the <code>DirtyAttribute</code> and execute some logic. With unity we denote a policy, a policy contains a set of matching rules and a set of call handlers. A matching rule will denote on which point the handler must be executed and the handler is the logic. In AOP this is called respectively a pointcut and an advice, the combination of the two is called an aspect. First, we are going to create our <code>DirtyHandler</code> by implementing the <code>ICallHandler</code> that resides in the <code>Microsoft.Unity.Interception</code> assembly.</p> <pre><code>public class DirtyHandler : ICallHandler\n{\n   public int Order { get; set; }\n\n   public IMethodReturn Invoke(IMethodInvocation input, GetNextHandlerDelegate getNext)\n   {\n      Advise(input.Target, input.MethodBase, input.Arguments[0]);\n      return getNext()(input, getNext);\n   }\n\n   private void Advise(object target, MemberInfo methodInfo, object value)\n   {\n      string propertyName = methodInfo.Name.Substring(\"set_\".Length);\n      PropertyInfo info = target.GetType().GetProperty(propertyName);\n\n      if (info != null)\n      {\n         object oldValue = info.GetValue(target, null);\n\n         if (!IsEqual(value, oldValue))\n            ((IDirty)target).IsDirty = true;\n      }\n   }\n\n   private bool IsEqual(object valueX, object valueY)\n   {\n      if (valueX == null &amp;&amp; valueY != null)\n         return false;\n\n      if (valueX != null &amp;&amp; valueY == null)\n         return false;\n\n      if (valueX == null &amp;&amp; valueY == null)\n         return true;\n\n      return valueX.Equals(valueY);\n   }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that in the <code>DirtyHandler</code> we did not specify when the dirty logic is executed, this is done by a set of matching rules that implement the <code>IMatchingRule</code> interface. In our case we have three criterias, first that it can only be applied to a setter property, secondly that the setter property must be annotated with the <code>DirtyAttribute</code> and finally that the class must implement the <code>IDirty</code> interface. In Unity we have predefined rules that we can use, in our case we can use the <code>PropertyMatchingRule</code> and the <code>CustomAttributeMatchingRule</code>. To detect that a particular instance implements a given type, I created the <code>InstanceOfMatchingRule</code>.</p> <pre><code>public class InstanceOfMatchingRule : IMatchingRule\n{\n   private readonly Type _type;\n\n   public InstanceOfMatchingRule(Type type)\n   {\n      _type = type;\n   }\n\n   public bool Matches(System.Reflection.MethodBase member)\n   {\n      return _type.IsAssignableFrom(member.DeclaringType);\n   }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now we are ready to configure our container for interception. Note that the interception mechanism inside Unity is implemented as an extension to the Unity block. Below we configure a policy named \"DirtyPolicy\" that executes the handler named \"DirtyHandler\" if it matches all three matching rules (<code>PropertyMatchingRule</code>, <code>CustomAttributeMatchingRule</code> and <code>InstanceOfMatchingRule</code>). In this example, we denote that the type <code>Customer</code> is configured with the <code>VirtualMethodInterceptor</code>. Note that this type of interception only works if your methods/properties are marked as virtual, which is the case for our <code>Customer</code> type (see <code>Customer.cs</code>).</p> <pre><code>// Start Configuration\nIUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer()\n   .AddNewExtension&lt;Interception&gt;()\n   .RegisterInstance&lt;ICallHandler&gt;(\"DirtyHandler\", new DirtyHandler());\n\ncontainer.Configure&lt;Interception&gt;()\n   .SetInterceptorFor&lt;Customer&gt;(new VirtualMethodInterceptor())\n   .AddPolicy(\"DirtyPolicy\")\n      .AddMatchingRule(new PropertyMatchingRule(\"*\", PropertyMatchingOption.Set))\n      .AddMatchingRule(new CustomAttributeMatchingRule(typeof(DirtyAttribute), true))\n      .AddMatchingRule(new InstanceOfMatchingRule(typeof(IDirty)))\n      .AddCallHandler(\"DirtyHandler\");\n// End Configuration\n\nvar customer = container.Resolve&lt;Customer&gt;();\n\nvar firstname = customer.FirstName;\nDebug.Assert(!customer.IsDirty);\ncustomer.FirstName = \"Piet\";\nDebug.Assert(customer.IsDirty);\n</code></pre> <p>The configuration part can also be done through a configuration file. Unfortunately, there is no schema available, this means that there is no validation and intellisense inside your Visual Studio! Especially to describe the matching rules through xml, I had to introduce some extra converters that implement the TypeConverter class. This enables you to convert to any kind of object started from a string. I introduced the <code>PropertyMatchingOptionConverter</code> and <code>GetTypeConverter</code>.</p> <pre><code>public class PropertyMatchingOptionConverter : System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter\n{\n   public override object ConvertFrom(System.ComponentModel.ITypeDescriptorContext context, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture, object value)\n   {\n      return (PropertyMatchingOption)Enum.Parse(typeof(PropertyMatchingOption), value.ToString());\n   }\n}\n\npublic class GetTypeConverter : System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter\n{\n   public override object ConvertFrom(System.ComponentModel.ITypeDescriptorContext context, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture, object value)\n   {\n      return Type.GetType(value.ToString());\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>

Our target class needed to implement the <code>IDirty</code> interface, and the setter properties (annotated with the Dirty attribute) assigned the Dirty flag (of <code>IDirty</code>) when the value has changed. Take for example the following classes:</p> <pre><code>[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method, AllowMultiple = false, Inherited = true)]\npublic class DirtyAttribute : System.Attribute\n{\n}\n\npublic interface IDirty\n{\n    bool IsDirty { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class Customer\n{\n    public virtual string FirstName { get; [Dirty] set; }\n    public virtual string LastName { get; [Dirty] set; }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that in contrast to Part 1, the Customer object doesn\u2019t implement the <code>IDirty</code> interface. In this example we are going to use a mixin for dirty tracking, a mixin is a class that provides a certain functionality to be inherited by a subclass, but is not meant to stand alone. That\u2019s exactly what we want to achieve, that is to provide extra functionality, namely dirty tracking, to our Customer object.</p> <p>We simply have to implement the <code>IDirty</code> interface once and for all and call it for example <code>DirtyMixin</code>.</p> <pre><code>[Serializable]\npublic class DirtyMixin : IDirty\n{\n   public bool IsDirty { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>As interception and mixin mechanism we use Castle\u2019s DynamicProxy, the latest build can be found here. To intercept our (dirty) properties we need to implement an interface called IInterceptor. In the implementation we write the code that need to be executed (advice) at particular points (pointcut) in the program. Note that with Unity we have the notion of IMatchingRule for defining Pointcuts, whereas in DynamicProxy we have to do it manually.</p> <pre><code>public class DirtyInterceptor : Castle.Core.Interceptor.IInterceptor\n{\n    public void Intercept(Castle.Core.Interceptor.IInvocation invocation)\n    {\n        if (PointCut(invocation.Proxy, invocation.Method))\n        {\n            Advise(invocation.Proxy, invocation.Method, invocation.GetArgumentValue(0));\n        }\n\n        invocation.Proceed();\n    }\n\n    bool PointCut(object target, MethodInfo methodInfo)\n    {\n        if (IsSetter(methodInfo) &amp;&amp; target is IDirty)\n        {\n            object[] dirtyAttributes = methodInfo.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(DirtyAttribute), true);\n            return (dirtyAttributes != null &amp;&amp; dirtyAttributes.Length &gt; 0);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    void Advise(object target, MemberInfo methodInfo, object value)\n    {\n        string propertyName = methodInfo.Name.Substring(\"set_\".Length);\n        PropertyInfo info = target.GetType().GetProperty(propertyName);\n\n        if (info != null)\n        {\n            object oldValue = info.GetValue(target, null);\n\n            if (!IsEqual(value, oldValue))\n                ((IDirty)target).IsDirty = true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    bool IsSetter(MethodInfo methodInfo)\n    {\n        return (methodInfo.Name.StartsWith(\"set_\")) &amp;&amp; (methodInfo.GetParameters().Length == 1);\n    }\n\n    bool IsEqual(object valueX, object valueY)\n    {\n        if (valueX == null &amp;&amp; valueY != null)\n            return false;\n\n        if (valueX != null &amp;&amp; valueY == null)\n            return false;\n\n        if (valueX == null &amp;&amp; valueY == null)\n            return true;\n\n        return valueX.Equals(valueY);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>To generate our proxy we use the <code>ProxyGenerator</code> class that reside in the <code>Castle.DynamicProxy2</code> assembly.

This is very different from Branch coverage where each control structure is evaluated to true and false. In this case we would have 50% code coverage.</p> <pre><code>public class Foo\n{\n   public int Calculate(int x, int y)\n   {\n      if (x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 0)\n      {\n         return -1;\n      }\n      else\n      {\n         Console.WriteLine(x.ToString());\n         Console.WriteLine(x.ToString());\n         Console.WriteLine(x.ToString());\n         Console.WriteLine(x.ToString());\n         Console.WriteLine(x.ToString());\n         Console.WriteLine(x.ToString());\n         Console.WriteLine(x.ToString());\n         Console.WriteLine(x.ToString());\n         Console.WriteLine(x.ToString());\n         Console.WriteLine(x.ToString());\n\n         return 1;\n      }\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>","tags":["testing","visual-studio"]},{"location":"create-a-net-windows-service-in-5-steps-with-topshelf/","title":"Create a .NET Windows Service in 5 steps with Topshelf","text":"<p>Topshelf is an open-source hosting framework for building Windows Services using .NET.\u00a0With Topshelf you can create in a few lines of code your own windows service.

persisted as a json object and separated by a newline. If we look more closely to one of the events you see that we have a Properties collection that contains the Enrich values and the values passed through the property values collection.</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"Timestamp\": \"2014-05-09T20:01:43.9510191+02:00\",\n  \"Level\": \"Information\",\n  \"MessageTemplate\": \"I sat at {@Chair}\",\n  \"RenderedMessage\": \"I sat at { Back: \"straight\", Legs: [1, 2, 3, 4] }\",\n  \"Properties\": {\n    \"Chair\": {\n      \"Back\": \"straight\",\n      \"Legs\": [\n        1,\n        2,\n        3,\n        4\n      ]\n    },\n    \"ThreadId\": 1,\n    \"MachineName\": \"MyMachine\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>With\u00a0Json.NET\u00a0we can deserialize the log file so that we can use LINQ to query our log events. We have LogEventLevel and LogEvent that represent our log item.</p> <pre><code>public enum LogEventLevel\n{\n    Verbose,\n    Debug,\n    Information,\n    Warning,\n    Error,\n    Fatal\n}\n\npublic class LogEvent\n{\n    public DateTimeOffset Timestamp { get; set; }\n    public LogEventLevel Level { get; set; }\n    public string MessageTemplate { get; set; }\n    public string RenderedMessage { get; set; }\n    public string Exception { get; set; }\n    public Dictionary&lt;string, JToken&gt; Properties { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the generated json file is not valid and that we need to separate each log event with a comma and make an array of it. Below you have a util class that will do all the plumbing and note that\u00a0we are using FileStream so that it can also be read even when the file is in use.</p> <pre><code>public class SerilogUtils\n{\n    public static IEnumerable Load(string jsonPath)\n    {\n        var json = string.Empty;\n\n        using (var fs = new FileStream(jsonPath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.ReadWrite))\n        using (var sr = new StreamReader(fs, Encoding.Default))\n        {\n            json = sr.ReadToEnd();\n        }\n\n        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(json))\n            return Enumerable.Empty();\n\n        json = json.Replace(Environment.NewLine, \",\");\n        json = \"[\" + json + \"]\";\n\n        var logEvents = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;List&gt;(json);\n        return logEvents;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>LINQPad is a great tool to play with LINQ queries. Just make a reference to Json.NET\u00a0and use the following using statements inside LINQPAD and after that you can do all sort of reports about you're log events.</p> <ul> <li>Newtonsoft.Json</li> <li>Newtonsoft.Json.Linq</li> <li>System.Linq</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Below are some query examples</p> <pre><code>logEvents = logEvents.Where(x =&gt; x.Level == LogEventLevel.Information);\nlogEvents = logEvents.Where(x =&gt; (int)x.Properties[\"ThreadId\"] == 1);\nlogEvents = logEvents.Where(x =&gt; !string.IsNullOrEmpty(x.Exception));\n\nvar result = logEvents\n    .Where(x =&gt; x.Properties.ContainsKey(\"MessageId\"))\n    .GroupBy(x =&gt; (int)x.Properties[\"MessageId\"]);\n</code></pre> <p>In the next blog post we will go a little further and see how we can customize the layout and use json path expressions.</p>"},{"location":"archive/2014/","title":"2014","text":""},{"location":"archive/2012/","title":"2012","text":""},{"location":"archive/2011/","title":"2011","text":""},{"location":"archive/2009/","title":"2009","text":""},{"location":"archive/2008/","title":"2008","text":""},{"location":"archive/2007/","title":"2007","text":""},{"location":"archive/2006/","title":"2006","text":""},{"location":"archive/2005/","title":"2005","text":""},{"location":"archive/2004/","title":"2004","text":""},{"location":"page/2/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/3/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/4/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/5/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/6/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/7/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/8/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/9/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/10/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/11/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/12/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"page/13/","title":"Home","text":""},{"location":"archive/2008/page/2/","title":"2008","text":""},{"location":"archive/2007/page/2/","title":"2007","text":""},{"location":"archive/2006/page/2/","title":"2006","text":""},{"location":"archive/2006/page/3/","title":"2006","text":""},{"location":"archive/2006/page/4/","title":"2006","text":""},{"location":"archive/2006/page/5/","title":"2006","text":""},{"location":"archive/2005/page/2/","title":"2005","text":""},{"location":"archive/2005/page/3/","title":"2005","text":""},{"location":"archive/2004/page/2/","title":"2004","text":""}]}
